This is a simple JavaScript application. 

You can choose the pizza and it should view a name and price of item.
After clicking "Order" button pizza will go grey beacause it's sold-out.

You can change opening hours. If for example it's 10pm and closing time is set to 9pm, you won't be able to "Order".
